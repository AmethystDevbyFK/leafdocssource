# How to add Leaf to your world/realm

Leaf is a open source, feature-rich MCBE Addon.

It is really easy to set up, and I am here to help!

## Common problems

You must have ```"Beta APIs"``` on as it uses @minecraft/server and @minecraft/server-ui.

### How to download
You must download in the '#downloads' channel! We don't like ad links because we don't want your money lmao

### I can't open the Config UI, help!

You must be running the latest version of Minecraft and Leaf Essentials! If there was just a minecraft update, you have to wait until trash gets on to fix it.
Make sure that you have the ```admin``` tag.

If you need more help regarding adding to worlds, just ask our wonderful support team @ discord.gg/leafessentials
