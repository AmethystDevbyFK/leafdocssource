# Setting up Leaf Essentials

## Admin Features
The most basic thing about Leaf (arguably) is the sidebar. Alot of people download Leaf because of the Sidebar and the UI Builder. They are the best Leaf features and people with servers can agree!

To use the Config Panel, Block Property Editor, Entity Property Editor + more, use ```/tag @s add admin``` in the chat.

## Binding
Binding is another simple feature and is one of the only admin features that actually has a command. Do !bind ```command``` to execute a command.
For example, if i wanted to bind the "Navigator" item to my main UI i would do ```!bind scriptevent leaf:open mainui```. We will go on to the UI Builder documentation soon.
