# UI Builder

The UI Builder is one of the main features of Leaf Essentials! You can choose an icon and run commands with the action form buttons. You can also do /js ```javascript arg``` and use javascript code in-game! You can do loads with the UI Builder and this page will tell you all about it.

## How do I make a UI?
To make a UI in Leaf, you must open the Config Panel. If you followed the previous steps, the Config Panel should work.
Open ```Main Settings``` and click UI Builder.
Click ```Add UI```
Enter your title. This will be showed at the top of your form and you should pick something like ```Main UI``` or ```AmethystNetworkMain```. Anything that would look good!
Enter your body. This will be a small bit of text under the title. ```This is optional```
Enter your ```scriptevent``` Please dont let the example decieve you. Make sure the scriptevent only has the name. For example, ```ui/main``` to keep it organised (that's how I like to do it)
Select the type of UI you want. If you want to add descriptions to your buttons, i'd recommend not choosing ```Grid UI```. If the UI Format doesn't change and stays as the normal form, Leaf's RP needs to be at the top of the list.
